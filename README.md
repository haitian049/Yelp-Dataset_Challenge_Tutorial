# Yelp-Dataset_Challenge_Tutorial

In this tutorial project I decided to use the Yelp dataset to create demos on natural language processing and machine learning.

Natural Language processing, in particular, is how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
Where can you find natural language data? That's right, in the Yelp dataset which contains 2.2 Million reviews on businesses from 552,000 users.
Wow, that's a lot of reviews and processing which can end up being a tideous nightmare, however, computers gives us a leverage of processing huge amounts of data in a fraction of the time.

Instead of reading through all those reviews and processing the data ourselves , we can teach the computer a algorithm that will do the job for us.
Python is a efficent and easy programing language that can be used to write our algorithm which in return will process our natural language data.

Now, once our data has been processed we can use it as input data for our machine learning algorithm (Artificial Intelligence). Our algorithm will learn our natural language data after it has been processed and create vocabulary. This vocabulary will have every word interconnected in a high dimensional matrix we can later use to execute concepts like word algebra.

What is word algebra, well, let think of two words like "apple" and "purple". If we decide to ADD the two words together we are just concatenating the string "apple" and "purple". However, if we apply a numerical representation of the word "apple" and "purple" as a matrix, then the word "plum" is plausible as a result.

Hence, matrix algebra (Linear Algebra) is required to make this bizzare concept a reality...What is a matrix?

A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers into rows and columns. Each number in a matrix is referred to as a matrix element or entry. Below is a example matrix we will name "Matrix A" :

1 2 3

4 5 6

The dimensions of a matrix give the number of rows and columns of the matrix in that order. Since "matrix A" has 2 rows and 3 columns, it is called a 2Ã—3 matrix.

If this is new to you, I recommend that you check out a lesson covering "intro to matrices"...with that said,

As long as the dimensions of two matrices are the same, we can add and subtract them much like we add and subtract numbers.

P.S:

This project was a well repspect learning process because I had very little to no experience with Python before starting the project. Now, I'm pretty confident in the using Python as a programming language and will reccomend to anybody who deals with high dimensional matrices
